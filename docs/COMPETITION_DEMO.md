# 🏆 RIFT Finance - Solana Hackathon Submission

## 🎯 The Problem
Global trade finance is broken:
- **$1.5 trillion financing gap** for SMEs
- **30-90 day payment terms** kill cash flow
- **Paper-heavy processes** cost 5-10% in fees
- **No transparency** in cross-border settlements

## 💡 Our Solution
RIFT is a **decentralized trade finance platform** that uses:
- ✅ **Solana blockchain** for instant settlement
- ✅ **Stablecoin liquidity** (EURC) for cross-border payments
