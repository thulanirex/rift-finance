# 🎯 Operator Portal - Complete Guide

### **3. Navigation** (AppLayout)

### **4. User Flow**

```

## 🔐 Access Control

All operator routes are protected with:
- `ProtectedRoute` - Requires authentication
- `RoleGuard` - Only allows 'operator' or 'admin' roles

## 📊 Database Integration

**All operator pages use MySQL via apiClient:**
- ✅ OperatorDashboard - Uses `apiClient.invoices.getAll()`
- ✅ OperatorInvoices - Uses `apiClient.invoices.getAll()`, `approve()`, `reject()`
- ⚠️ OperatorKYB - Needs update (still uses Supabase)
- ⚠️ OperatorFunders - Needs update (stub file)
- ✅ OperatorPools - Uses MySQL
- ✅ OperatorAudit - Uses MySQL

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Create Operator Account

```sql
-- In MySQL
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at) 
VALUES (
  UUID(), 
  'operator@rift.finance', 
  '$2a$10$...',  -- Use bcrypt hash
  'operator', 
  NOW()
);
```

### 2. Login as Operator
1. Go to `/auth`
2. Login with operator credentials
3. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard/operator`

### 3. Test Invoice Approval Flow
1. **As Seller**: Submit an invoice
2. **As Operator**: 
   - Go to Dashboard
   - See pending count increase
   - Click "Review now"
   - Select invoice

3. **Verify**: Invoice status changes to "approved"
4. **As Funder**: See invoice in Market
